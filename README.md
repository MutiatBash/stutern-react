#### 4 - 3 differences between HTML & JSX

- In JSX, javascript objects can be used to define styles for elements, while for HTML it uses CSS inline style attribute
- JSX allows us to create components, while in HTML we create elements
  -In JSX, we can add event handlers directly to elements using special props, while in HTML, we write the javascript code seperately

#### 5 - Why browsers can read JSX

They can't read JSX because it is not valid javascript code. It needs to be transpiled using a tool like Babel, which converts it to javascript that the browser understands.
